	<p style="text-align:justify">I'm Ningjing Tang, an undergraduate student studying in the department of Computer Science and Technology in Xinya College, Tsinghua University.</p>
	<p style="text-align:justify">My research interests lie in the intersection of HCI and social computing. To be specific, my research aims to understand marginalized people's engagement on social media, especially the challenges they may encounter. I am also curious about how we can design and build new systems, or curate the existing ones to better support them and to empower them.</p>
	<p style="text-align:justify">I am fortunate to have been advised by <strong> <a href="https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~zhiconlu/">Prof. Zhicong Lu</a></strong>, and I have worked in <strong> <a href="https://thfl.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yjdw/yjs/index.htm">the Future Laboratory </a> </strong> affective computing group as a research intern.</p>
