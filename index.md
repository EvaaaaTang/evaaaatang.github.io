	<p style="text-align:justify">I'm Ningjing Tang, an undergraduate student studying in the department of Computer Science and Technology in Xinya College, Tsinghua University.</p>
	<p style="text-align:justify">My research interests lie in the intersection of HCI and social computing. The overarching goal of my research is to make algorithmic systems more inclusive. To make this happen, I want to 1) understand the social context where the system is produced and perceived, and 2)ultimately design better systems for underserved users. </p>
